You've learned a lot about web development so far. I want you to take a moment to write down your thoughts about web development here. Answer the following questions:
  * What new skills have you learned?
  * What has been easy?
  * What has been difficult?
  * How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?


- It was cool to brush up my html skills and i've learned a couple of new tags.
- My learning curve might look strange. I actually finished all but one more project. So pure html was easy;
- Nothing difficult.(see previous line);
- Considering the complexity of this project i was able to do it in one go. As always, having a clear picture of what is needed helped a lot.

Thank you.
